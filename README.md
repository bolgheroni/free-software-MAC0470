In this course, we're going to make changes to the IIO subsystem of the Linux Kernel. It is based on the tutorials available at the FLUSP site, listed below. 

This repo contains utilities that facilitate the flow of compiling and installing those changes in a local running VM in MY PERSONAL ENVIRONMENT.

My OS: fedora 6.0.7-301.fc37.x86_64
My VM: debian-12.5.0-amd64
